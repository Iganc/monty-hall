The program should include the following input parameters:

number_of_rounds: the number of game rounds to simulate.
player_strategy: a variable indicating whether the player will switch their choice or stick with the initial one.
At the end, the program should output the total number of wins and losses 

How do the conclusions about strategy change if the number of boxes is increased to N (e.g., N=100)? How many boxes should the host open for the conclusions from the three-box scenario to still hold true? (2 points)
